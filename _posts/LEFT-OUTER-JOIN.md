I created a simple dataset in order to demonstrate the use of LEFT OUTER JOIN. There are two tables - customers, and orders. The first SELECT statement demonstrates using a LEFT OUTER JOIN in order to view all customers and all orders; note this includes customers who did not order anything. The second SELECT statement demonstrates using a LEFT OUTER JOIN, combined with GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses to determine which customer spent the most money.
